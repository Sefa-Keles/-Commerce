## Deployment
This website design was produced with the Visual Studio Code IDE. Git was used as the version control system and saved in GitHub repositories. I used the $git -init command to start this project. Then I used the git status code to check the status of the written codes, then git add so that my local repository could see the written codes. I used the command. I saved this file to our local repository by leaving a commit message with git commit - m "xxxxxxxxx". I performed the SSH-keygen operation before doing the push operation. Then I validated my attempt by using the new feature of github, token usage. As the last step, I applied the push operation and saved it to the remote repository. I will do these operations again in every development and update of the project.
